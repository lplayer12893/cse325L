Project 4: CPU Scheduler Problem

DESCRIPTION:

This is  the implementation of the user-mode thread scheduler for both Round-
Robin and First-Come First Served scheduling policies.



FILE LIST:

scheduler.c: includes a skeleton of a scheduler that uses functions defined
	in scheduler_impl.c
scheduler.h: header file for scheduler.c above
dummy_impl.c: implements a OS scheduled algorithm
sched_impl.h: header file for sched_impl.c below. Contains data structures per
	scheduler instance and worker thread, as well as synchronization
	structures
sched_impl.c: implements both FCFS and RR scheduling policies to be used by
	scheduler.c above
list.h: header file for list.c below
list.c: implements operations for a linked list
lab4_tests.c: contains the main function as well as functions testing the 
	scheduler
testrunner.c: contains test cases for checking the scheduler solutions
testrunner.h: header file for testrunner.c above

COMPILATION:
    To compile, run 'make'. It should output the executable 'scheduler'.

INVOCATION:
    To invoke the program, simply run 'make test'. All tests should pass.

KNOWN BUGS:
    No known bugs.
